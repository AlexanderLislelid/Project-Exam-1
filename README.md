Brief

Build a front-end user interface for an existing e-commerce API. The client requires a responsive web application that lets users view products (description, price, rating, and reviews when available), log in to purchase products, and log out after checking out.

Use the owner account you created to test functionality. On submission, your client must be able to register, log in, and purchase products.
